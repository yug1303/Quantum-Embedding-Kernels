I genrated random blue and ret dots for dataset and model is trained to classify them in reigion.
â€¢ The accuracy on classifying data instances was therefore increased from 0.58 to 0.83. For some cases the accuracy may even be improved to 1,
and the program was made robust enough to avoid bad generalizations.
